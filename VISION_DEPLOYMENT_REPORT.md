## 🌍 CONCEPT

The Vision page represents the ultimate expression of 1142 LABS' mission: a future where consciousness research, neuroscience, and cognitive enhancement transform the entire planet. The cyberpunk aesthetic—neon circuitry, bioluminescent oceans, holographic brains, DNA helixes—is not decoration. It's a preview of what happens when science becomes culture, when the laboratory becomes the world.
